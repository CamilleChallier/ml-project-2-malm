# CS-422 Machine Learning Project 2

## Aim

Sleep is vital for emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and daily cognition. Sleep disorders, prevalent and associated with various health issues, reveal a disconnect between objective and subjective sleep quality. This study, using machine learning, aims to identify this link and quantify the importance of different parameters in predicting subjective sleep quality.
